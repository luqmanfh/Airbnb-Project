# Airbnb-Project

### Project Overview
This project provides a visual analysis of rental prices across different zip codes and the average price per bedroom. The dashboard offers insights into revenue trends and pricing patterns in the specified area, represented by the given zip codes.

### Data Source
The primary dataset for this analysis is the "listing.csv" and "calendar.csv" containing detailed information about price, location, and sale made by the company

### Tools
Tableau: Used for data visualization, map rendering, and creating interactive charts.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer key questions, such as:
1. Which zipcode has the highest average rental price?
2. What factors could explain the significant variation in revenue across different zip codes?
3. Are there any correlations between the zip code with the highest average price and the zip 
   code with the highest revenue?

### Results
The analysis results are summarized as follows:
Hereâ€™s a summarized analysis based on the data visualization:
1. Price Variability Across Zip Codes: Rental prices vary significantly across zip codes. The   
   highest average rental price is in 98134
2. Revenue Distribution: 98122 generates the highest revenue
3. Annual Revenue Trends: Revenue consistently grows throughout the year, peaking towards the 
   end. This could indicate a seasonal demand for rental properties or other market factors 
   affecting rental activity over time
